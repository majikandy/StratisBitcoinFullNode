Welcome to Stratis puzzle and congratulations for going through the stage one!

Your objective here is to solve 12 puzzles. You already solved the first one, so 11 more remains. 
Solving each puzzle reveals a dictionary word. If you solve 9 puzzles, we will be very glad 
if you contact us and apply for a job in Stratis, in which case we ask you to describe solutions of the puzzles.

If you solve all 12 puzzles and you are first one to do so, you can claim the price of 1000 STRATs.

The price is stored in the following Stratis addresses: `SNAyGkY7z2xTf4DbWSrUHErxarQhUGoFjH`, `SeZ1FewXsNjXvYBxfWXgceJPEdS62czS4u`, `ScxtSq3jLXWpo7u6Z1wGQQHaQSDD49acfc`, `Sj1KYEeEXJagKzQ2DzAySQuYwkwh4hvH3h`

You can use the [Stratis Blockchain Explorer](https://chainz.cryptoid.info/strat/) to see if someone claimed the price already.

You can find the puzzles in the `words` folder. To start solving the second puzzle, start with `market`.
